## AWS WAF Security Configuration Check List

### Manual IP lists:
This component creates two specific AWS WAF rules that allow you to manually insert IP addresses that you want to block (blacklist) or allow (whitelist).

### SQL Injection And XSS:
The solution configures two native AWS WAF rules that are designed to protect against common SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) patterns in the URI, query string, or body of a request.

### HTTP flood:
This component protects against attacks that consist of a large number of requests from a particular IP address, such as a web-layer DDoS attack or a brute-force login attempt.

### Scanners and Probes:
This component parses application access logs searching for suspicious behavior, such as an abnormal amount of errors generated by an origin. It then blocks those suspicious source IP addresses for a customer-defined period of time.

### IP Reputation Lists:
This component is the IP Lists Parser AWS Lambda function which checks third-party IP reputation lists hourly for new ranges to block.

### Bad Bots:
This component automatically sets up a honeypot, which is a security mechanism intended to lure and deflect an attempted attack.
